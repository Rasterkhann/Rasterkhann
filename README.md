## Join Up

You can join [the Discord](https://discord.gg/MG8cNts) to suggest features, report bugs, or anything of the sort!

## Developing

* `npm start` to run the game locally
* `npm run build` to build a production copy of the game
* `npm run test` to run any tests

### Notes

* Some imports are very specific to avoid circular import errors. If you get circular import errors, make your `helper`/`static` imports more specific.

## New Features

Please run your feature ideas past me first! I would hate to have a fantastic PR but having it not be aligned with the games goals.

## Design

WIP Design [in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pecc--sRZj-DKdZyzmnUy1wXZyEDoUtYtG7Mtt0ZdqU/edit).
